Assignment 1
Part 1:
 
 

I chose After Motherwell by Vik Muniz because I find contemporary art very fascinating. After scrolling through the HAM website and the CSV file, I found many pros and cons for both platforms. First, I found the CSV files to be a versatile option. They make downloading data a breeze, which is fantastic for offline access. The control they offer is invaluable, allowing researchers to manipulate data using spreadsheet software or powerful programming languages like Python or R for tailored analyses and transformations. When dealing with specialized tasks or working with subsets of data, CSV files are lightning-fast, which can save a lot of time. However, CSV files come with their fair share of limitations. One significant drawback is the lack of contextual information. Often, they don’t provide extensive descriptions, high-quality photos, or essential metadata, which are crucial for in-depth research. And let’s not forget the tedious process of data cleaning and validation that often accompanies CSV files due to errors, inconsistencies, and missing values. Plus, CSV files may lag in updates, which can be problematic when you need the latest information.
On the other hand, museum websites offer a treasure trove of comprehensive and engaging research materials. They enrich your study with beautiful photographs, detailed descriptions, historical context, and even multimedia tools. The real-time updates provided by these websites ensure you’re always in the loop about new exhibitions, events, and research findings. Museum primary sources are a goldmine of accuracy and reliability, making them a trusted resource for any researcher. Some websites even offer virtual tours and excellent search options, elevating the entire research experience. Nonetheless, there are some downsides to relying solely on museum websites. Data export options can be limited, especially for large-scale research projects, which can hamper your ability to perform flexible data analysis. Navigating through large museum websites can be a frustrating ordeal, making it time-consuming to find specific information or artifacts. Moreover, you might run into connectivity issues, which can be a major roadblock when trying to access these websites reliably. 
Overall, I believe that using the website was much more enjoyable, especially for someone with little to no experience with data. The metadata provided gave enough information about the art piece, even though I would have liked a brief description of the meaning behind this specific art piece.

Part 2:
For the second section, I chose to look at Italian culture, as I am a huge fan of the Renaissance, and I find Italian art very beautiful. 
Most Viewed:





The most viewed piece, as one may predicted, is Mystic Crucifixion by Sandro Botticelli. 

The painting depicts the crucifixion of Jesus Christ symbolically and mystically. It is known for its unique and somewhat unconventional representation of the crucifixion scene. You can see Jesus Christ on the cross in the center of the composition. Surrounding him are various figures, including the Virgin Mary, St. John the Evangelist, and other saints and angels. The painting often includes rich symbolism and religious iconography, reflecting Botticelli’s mastery of storytelling through art. Botticell's piece is considered one of the most important contributions to Renaissance art, characterized by its attention to detail, use of symbolism, and classical influences. 

Least Viewed:

The least viewed object is a small sculpture called Doves, after a mosaic by an Unidentified Artist.


It is very evident why this is the least viewed object as it’s very boring, small, and by an unknown artist. This is not to say the object does not hold any value, but it is incredibly uninteresting. 


 
Italian:
As we can, the Italian culture is the most dominant in terms of pieces. This result is very predictable since Italian art and culture have had a profound and enduring impact on the world throughout history. Italy’s artistic and cultural contributions have transcended borders and continue influencing various aspects of human civilization. Italian art also varies across many artistic mediums, whether it is through sculptures, paintings, and architecture. Finally, I believe it’s important to mention that the culture being Euro-centric may influence Harvard Museum’s interest in collecting it and having huge access to the art pieces. In terms of acquisition peaks, I find it interesting that there were two very distinct peaks in the time series graph from the late 1910s to the late 1930s. I can not theorize the reason behind those peaks, but I just think it’s important to mention them. 

Indian:
As for the Indian culture, I believe that it’s fair for it to have a significantly lesser number of pieces relative to the Italian culture. Although the Indian art culture’s spiritual and symbolic elements have left an indelible mark on global artistic expression, I still think that it is not nearly as commonly recognized as influential compared to the Italian culture. However, there was an interesting peak in approximately the year 2009. Reports are claiming that Indian art became more globally recognized in 2009, where “Sotheby’s annual sale of Indian art in London on June 16 achieved Rs 16.33 crore, much above the pre-sale expectations of 1.2 million pounds (Rs 9.44 crore) while Christie’s South Asian Modern and Contemporary Art sale in London on June 10 saw a 1960 painting by M F Husain fetching a staggering Rs 3.1 crore” (Press Trust of India and Business Standard). I do not fully understand the significance of these sales figures, but I’m assuming it is a huge deal. 

Islamic:
  Finally, we can see that the Islamic culture has the least amount of pieces. I think it’s a shame that Islamic art is so little compared to the other two cultures, especially because Islamic art and culture have a rich heritage that spans over 1,400 years. Rooted in the Islamic faith, this culture encompasses a wide range of artistic expressions, including calligraphy, geometric patterns, and arabesque designs. Islamic art is characterized by its avoidance of figurative representation and a focus on intricate ornamentation. The Islamic art culture has many notable achievements, including the grand architecture of mosques like the Hagia Sophia and the Taj Mahal, as well as the development of exquisite ceramics, textiles, and illuminated manuscripts. Overall, the culture has had a global influence and continues to be celebrated for its beauty and craftsmanship, reflecting the diversity and creativity of Muslim cultures worldwide. I believe the diversity of the Islamic art culture is the main culprit behind why it seems the Harvard Museum holds a small collection of it. Islam is so widespread across countries, cultures, and histories. Additionally, there are no clear distinctions between cultural art and religious art in most Muslim countries and societies, making it harder to categorize such art accurately. I believe these reasons are why the number of Islamic art pieces is so insignificant compared to the other cultures.

Part 3:
Italian:

The word cloud for the Italian culture, before removing the stop words, seems very messy, but we still get an idea of what to expect. Words like “Christ,” “madonna,” and “saint” imply that there is a common religious theme throughout the art pieces. A word that seems striking and somewhat confuses me is “Egypt.” It makes me wonder if there is an Orientalist theme or scene throughout the Italian art culture. 

  After cleaning the word cloud, “child” and “head” immediately yell at you to see them. They are so common that all the less trendy words are extremely tiny and hard to read. Although the Christian theme is still prevalent, I think painting children and beheadings or sculpting the heads of people and Greek mythology figures is much more popular, which is weird. Also, “Egypt” seems to have disappeared, which is confusing and interesting.

Indian:

  The first thing I noticed about the unedited Indian word cloud is that there is much less diversity in words compared to the Italian word cloud. I predict the edited version will have a very common religious theme, based on the words “Krishna” and “manuscript.”

  Immediately what caught my eye about the edited word cloud is how common “i” is used. I tried looking into the reason behind it, but I could not figure it out. “Krishna” is still very common, as well as “Rajput,” which Wikipedia describes as “a large multi-component cluster of castes, kin bodies, and local groups, sharing social status and ideology of genealogical descent originating from the Indian subcontinent” (Wikipedia contributors). It seems the Indian culture does not focus primarily on Hinduism or religion in general but more so on people, explaining the presence of pronouns like “his,” “her,” and “he,” and descriptions like “wear” and “turban.”

Islamic:

Finally, the Islamic culture results for both the unedited and edited word clouds are very predictable. Since it is centered around Islamic art, I expected the words to be words describing Islamic elements such as the Qur’an and a Sura. However, what I found interesting is the presence of the word “right.” In Islam, a person must always lead their life with their right side. For example, Muslims are expected to always eat with their right hand, enter the car or any place with their right leg, and even when they’re putting on their socks or wearing their pants, they’re expected to lead with their right side. I am not sure if this is why the word “right” is present in the word cloud, but it is interesting to consider that idea.
